I made this "myself" because i was frustrated with my school's CBT app.

This app is the continuation of MAN IT Club's (github.com/itclubmanmet) CBT app, but i also made that app :P (because i'm a IT Club member)

## "Feature"
as of right now, this app doesn't have that much feature but here's a list of them:

- "Kiosk" Mode (Pin)
- Sound when exiting (NOT WORKING PROPERLY)
- No Bluetooth
- Disable opening the app in Windowed mode
