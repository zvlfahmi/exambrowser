I made this "myself" because i was frustrated with my school's CBT app.

This app is the continuation of [MAN IT Club's CBT App](https://github.com/itclubmanmet/exambrowser-man), but i also made that app :P (because i'm a IT Club member)

## "Feature"
as of right now, this app doesn't have that much feature but here's a list of them:

- "Kiosk" Mode (Pin) (added in v0.1b)
- Sound when exiting (added in v0.1b)
- No Bluetooth (added in v0.1b)
- Disable opening the app in Windowed mode (added in v0.1b)
